        <p> EarthRef.org supports a JupyterHub server where you can run PmagPy notebooks and create your own. 
          Login using your EarthRef(MagIC) username(handle) and password. If you don't know your EarthRef username and password, 
          login to the MagIC website at the <a href="https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC">home page</a>. You can 
          login using your ORCID id or your 
          username and password, or create an account with your ORCID id. You can then view, set, or edit your 
          username and password by clicking on your name in the upper right of the webpage. If you created your 
          account with an ORCID id, you will have to set your username and password before logging into the JupyterHub.

          This notebook covers how to use PmagPy in three parts. 
          Exercise 1 looks at a typical "directional" data set and shows how to make useful plots like the equal area projection, maps of VGPs and maps of site locations. 
          Exercise 2 shows how to get geomagnetic vectors from IGRF-like tables and several ways of looking at the data through time and space. 
          Exercise 3 considers directional (polarity), anisotropy data and natural gamma radiation (NGR), a measure of the dominance of clay versus diatomaceous ooze in this core, as a function of depth in an IODP core.<br/>
